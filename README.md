# Hiya!

## I'm Lamb, a back-end developer.
(How could I give up such a lovely github name though)

### My stack, sorted by proficiency:
- TypeScript / NodeJS
- Python3
- Rust
- Java
- C#
- LUA

Most of my experience is in Web Scraping / Web Automation, though I've done a lot of back-end API design and implementation.
